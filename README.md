# Phase 2 Software Training Repository

Welcome to the phase 2 Software Training Repository for the Vortex ROV team! This repository is designed to support and streamline our training program by providing a centralized location for code management, resources, and guidelines.

## Repository Structure

- **`/GUI`**, **`/ML_CV`**, **`/Control`**: Each sub-team has a dedicated folder to upload and maintain their code throughout Phase 2 training. Please ensure your code is well-organized and documented within your sub-teams folder.

## General Rules

1. **Code Submission:** Each sub-team is responsible for uploading their code to their designated folder. Code submission is done by making a branch from the main branch, adding your code and making the necessary modifications, and then submitting a pull request. You can continue to use the same branch throughout phase 2 training.
2. **Folder Organization:** Maintain a clean and organized folder structure. Use clear filenames and directories to make navigation easy.
3. **Documentation:** Provide thorough documentation for all code and projects.
5. **Support: ** If you have any questions or issues, please contact Mazen-Sakr for help.

We look forward to a productive training period and encourage you to participate as much as possible as that will be the main factor in improving your skills and allowing you to continue to phase 2. Happy coding!
